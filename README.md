# Alacritty Configuration (Personal)

This repository contains my personal configuration files for Alacritty, a cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator. Alacritty aims to be a modern and efficient terminal emulator with a clean and minimalistic design.

## Getting Started

To use my personalized Alacritty configuration, follow the steps below:

1. **Installation**: Ensure that you have Alacritty installed on your system. If not, refer to the official Alacritty documentation for instructions on how to install it for your operating system.

2. **Backup**: Before proceeding, it's always a good idea to backup your existing Alacritty configuration, if you have one. This allows you to easily revert back in case something goes wrong.

3. **Clone**: Clone this repository to a directory of your choice using the following command:

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
```

4. **Configuration**: Navigate to the cloned repository and copy the configuration files to the appropriate location. The configuration file is named `alacritty.yml`. The location may vary depending on your operating system. For example, on Linux, it is usually `~/.config/alacritty/`, and on macOS, it is `~/Library/Preferences/alacritty/`.

```sh
cp -r ./alacritty ~/.config/
```

5. **Customization**: Feel free to modify the `alacritty.yml` file according to your preferences. You can change the colors, fonts, keybindings, and various other options. The configuration file is well-documented, and you can refer to the official Alacritty documentation for detailed explanations of each option.

6. **Launch**: Once you've made your desired changes, launch Alacritty, and you should see your new configuration in action. Enjoy your personalized terminal experience!
